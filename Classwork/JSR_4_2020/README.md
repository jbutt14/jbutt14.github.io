### Course Overview
This course has 20 classes. It will begin with the fundamentals of JavaScript, including programming concepts such as data types, variables, and loops—the core concepts of programming. We'll then move into OOP and learn how to exchange information and functionality within our programs. From there, we'll learn how JavaScript can be used to manipulate websites and applications.

In addition to in-class participation, students are expected to complete three projects at the end of Units 1, 2, and 4.

| Class | Title | Project Prompt | Project Deadline|

| **Unit 1: Fundamentals of JavaScript** | Lessons 0 - 6  | Slackbot: Introduced in Lesson 5| Slackbot: Due during Lesson 6-7|
| **Unit 2: The Browser and APIs** | Lessons 7 - 12 | Feedr: Introduced at the end of Lesson 11 and during Lesson 12 Lab Time| Feedr: Due before start of Lesson 15 |
| **Unit 3: Persisting Data and Advanced Topics**| Lessons 13 - 16 |Final Project: Introduced at end of Lesson 14| |
